Part 1 - Basic Knowledge:

1.What is React.js?
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2.What are the key features of React.js?
JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)
Virtual DOM
One-way data binding
Performance
Extensions
Conditional statements
Components
Simplicity

3.What is JSX?
A syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe the user interface.

4.What is a virtual DOM?
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

5.What is the difference between props and state?
Props are used to pass data from parent to child components, while state is used for managing a component's internal data.

6.What is the role of Redux in a React.js application?
Redux is a state management library used to manage global application state in React.

7.What is the purpose of React Router?
React Router is used for routing and navigation in a React application.



Part 2 - Code Implementation:

1.Create a simple React component that displays "Hello World!" as text.
function HelloWorld() {
  return <div>Hello World!</div>;
}

2.Create a form component with input fields for name and email.
function FormComponent() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Name"/>
      <input type="email" placeholder="Email" />
    </form>
  );
}

3.Implement a React component that displays a list of items.
function ItemList() {
  const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

4.Use React Router to create a multi-page application with a navigation menu.
Install React-router-dom
Import the necessary Routing Elements
Build the Routes :
      <main className="container">
        <Header/>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home/>}/>
          <Route path="/reservations" element={<ReserveSection/>} />
          <Route path="/usersDetails" element={<UsersDetails/>}/>
          <Route path="/pay" element={<PaymentSection/>} />
          <Route path="/bookingconfirmation" element={<ConfmirmedBooking/>}/>
        </Routes>
      </main>



Part 3 - Advanced Concepts:

1.Explain the concept of React hooks.
React hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and side effects, replacing class-based component features.

2.What are higher-order components in React and how are they useful?
Higher-order components (HOCs) are functions that wrap a component to provide additional functionality, enhancing reusability.

3.Explain the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering in React.
Server-side rendering (SSR) renders React components on the server and sends HTML to the client, while client-side rendering (CSR) renders components in the browser.

4.How would you optimize the performance of a React application?
To optimize React app performance, use techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization. Also, minimize unnecessary re-renders.

5.What is the role of context in React?
Context in React provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually. It's useful for sharing state with many components or configuration.



Part 4 - Real-world Application:

1.Describe a React.js project you have worked on and your contribution to it.
I built  efficient, user-friendly, maintainable and responsive reservation system for the restaurant from scratch:

2.How did you ensure the project was maintainable and scalable?
I organized the project into modular components, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
I utilized state management tools like React's built-in state to ensure data integrity and scalability as the application grows.
I provided comments and documentation to make the codebase more understandable for potential future developers.

3.What challenges did you face while working on the project, and how did you overcome them?
Managing the multi-step reservation process was challenging, but I used React Router to handle navigation and maintain a clear user flow.
Ensuring the accuracy of reservation and customer details was essential. I implemented client-side validation and incorporated error handling to guide users through the correct input.
Popup Window: Creating a confirmation portal-popup window required careful handling of UI state and user interactions. I used React Modals for this purpose.
